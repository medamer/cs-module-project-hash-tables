What Hash Table Solve
---------------------

* We need to look up some data quickly
    * Some data that was slow to generate or obtain
    
In lieu of linear search...

It doesn't matter if _n_ is small.  O(n) vs O(1)


Any time-consuming process:

* Memoization (caching)
* Network caching
* Indexing
* Removing duplicates from lists
* Detecting duplicates
* Counting duplicates
